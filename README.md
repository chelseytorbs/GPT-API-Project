# ChatGPT-Powered Ticket Management System

This project is a web-based interface that uses OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT API to manage, summarize, and prioritize software development tickets. The system ingests CSV files of tickets and displays AI-generated suggestions to help streamline productivity and reporting.

## Features

- **AI Summaries**: Generates brief, readable summaries for each ticket using the title and description.
- **Task Suggestions**: Recommends ways to resolve each ticket, including optional code or documentation links.
- **Priority Guidance**: Suggests which ticket to work on next based on priority and estimated completion time.
- **CSV Upload**: Accepts ticket data in CSV format with fields like Summary, Description, Priority, and Estimate.
- **User Interface**: Clean front-end displays ticket information and AI responses clearly.

## Technologies

- **Python** (Flask)
- **OpenAI API** (GPT-4o-mini)
- **Pandas** for CSV processing
- **HTML/CSS** for UI
- **JavaScript (optional)** if you're extending frontend interactivity
