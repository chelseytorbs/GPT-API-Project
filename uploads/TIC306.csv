*Reproduction Steps:*

# Set up UAP project on a Windows machine
# Build the UAP application using Make ({{make}} or {{make uap}} in the terminal)

*Current Outcome:*

UAP Make target skips running due to already being ‘up to date’.

*Desired Outcome:*

UAP Make target runs unless the UAP executable and all of the UAP codebase are up to date.",,Automation for Jira,Jonathan Forsgren,557058:f58131cb-b67d-43c7-b30d-6b58d40bd077,712020:d67b4b8a-9508-4ea0-b812-b399a2d24976,;11/Jul/24 11:37 AM;712020:d67b4b8a-9508-4ea0-b812-b399a2d24976;7200,28800,21600,7200,25%,28800,21600,7200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,Critical (ASAP!),,,,0|i00gtt:,Jonathan Forsgren,712020:d67b4b8a-9508-4ea0-b812-b399a2d24976,,,,7/11/2024 11:38,47 seconds,Jonathan Forsgren,712020:d67b4b8a-9508-4ea0-b812-b399a2d24976,,,,Critical (Entire system),,,,,,,,20 hours 29 minutes 37 seconds,,,,,10262_*:*_1_*:*_12264_*|*_10264_*:*_2_*:*_2690_*|*_10263_*:*_1_*:*_73649647_*|*_10268_*:*_1_*:*_2898_*|*_10267_*:*_1_*:*_68785_*|*_10269_*:*_2_*:*_38812,10/Jul/24 3:10 PM;712020:d67b4b8a-9508-4ea0-b812-b399a2d24976;May be caused by lack of {{uap}} target prerequisites.
