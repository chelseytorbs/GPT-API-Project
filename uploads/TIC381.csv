*Documentation Sections:*

* Create the “Processing Technical Documentation” page under the “Processing Technical Workflow” page, which will provide a brief description of the aims of the processing technical documentation pages, and under which all of the processing technical documentation pages will be nested. ✅ 
* Create the following pages: ✅ 

*Titles of Pages to Create*

* Processing Technical - Jpegging (300s) ✅ 
* Processing Technical - Stitching (400s) ✅ 
* Processing Technical - AI (500s) ✅ 
* Processing Technical - PCI Calculator (600s) ✅
* Processing Technical - Visualize+PowerBI+Player Round 1 (700s) ✅ 
* Processing Technical - Pavement Engineer Review (800s) ✅ 
* Processing Technical - Visualization / Publishing Data (900s) ✅ 
* Processing Technical - Delivery (1000s) ✅ 
* Processing Technical - Invoice (1100s) ✅ 
* Processing Technical - CICD (1200s) ✅ 
* Processing Technical - Data Organization (1300s) ✅ 
* Processing Technical - AI Process (1400s) ✅ 

* Copy over the content for each page from the “Processing Technical Workflow” page. ✅ 
** Update the headers for each page to appear consistently through each technical documentation page.
** Update the links on each page (links for jumping to the top of page, to caller functions, etc.) to ensure that they link to the accurate part of the correct page.

The next steps may not be completed until after the ticket has undergone a primary review and been approved. After the first review has been completed, it should be moved back into “In Progress” for the completion of the final steps of the process, after which it may be reviewed again.

* After all content from “Processing Technical Workflow” has been safely copied into new pages, remove all current content from the page.
* Rename the “Processing Technical Workflow” page (currently the root page for all processing documentation) to “Processing Documentation” and provide on links to its child pages, as well as brief descriptions of what each child page covers.",,Ruth Thomas,712020:ef3c2977-d10b-4818-8c36-06ef5624e4d2,;09/Sep/24 9:35 AM;712020:ef3c2977-d10b-4818-8c36-06ef5624e4d2;21600,;09/Sep/24 1:45 PM;712020:ef3c2977-d10b-4818-8c36-06ef5624e4d2;7200,144000,115200,28800,20%,144000,115200,28800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Medium (When convenient),,,,0|i00ht9:,Ruth Thomas,712020:ef3c2977-d10b-4818-8c36-06ef5624e4d2,,,,9/10/2024 12:38,,Jonathan Forsgren,712020:d67b4b8a-9508-4ea0-b812-b399a2d24976,,,,Major (Essential subsystem),,,,,,,,,,,,,,10/Sep/24 12:39 PM;712020:ef3c2977-d10b-4818-8c36-06ef5624e4d2;Submitted to review for primary review.,In Progress,9/6/2024 9:18
